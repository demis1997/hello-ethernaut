what i did to solve hello ethernaut ctf
The solution was pretty simple, after having a look at the files you notice that there are different functions such as info1 and info2, opening those will prompt you to open the next function until eventually you open one containing the password. 
Simply authenticating and getting cleared using the password and the method name will help you pass the ctf. The password can be found in one of the functions <img width="1536" alt="Untitled" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63403890/185647999-06e88a16-34b8-445e-ac6c-6964a0f8ce8b.png">
